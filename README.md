## Instructions

Your are building a cocktail-wiki that uses data from [The Cocktail DB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). You can see an example of a cocktail-wiki on their [The Cocktail DB Home Page](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/).

The web application will have atleast three different pages.

### Meal DB API

If you don't want to create an application that showcases alcoholic drinks, you can instead create an application around the [Meal DB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). It is a 'sister' API, which means it has the same creator and is structured the same way. The requirements below are the same in other words.

## Requirements

- Create the application using Vite and React Typescript.
- It is allowed to use CSS-frameworks in this assignment. But I rather you didn't. The focus should be and the React part and the logic but don't forget about the CSS.

- On this page the user should get detailed information on a specific cocktail including the following:

  - Category
  - Image

On this page it could be a good opportunity to learn about dynamic segments in React Router: [Dynamic segments](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route#dynamic-segments) **Observe**: this is not required in order to solve the exercise.

## Provided Helper

You’ve been given a helper function:

```ts
mapRawCocktailData(rawCocktail): ICocktail
```

It cleans up the messy API response and returns a simpler cocktail object.
Use it to avoid dealing with null fields and confusing keys.

You’ll find it in:
`src/mapRawCocktailData.ts`

But put it somewhere in your folder structure where it makes sense.
